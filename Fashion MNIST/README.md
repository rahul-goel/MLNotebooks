# Fashion MNIST

https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

It is well known that the original MNIST Dataset is now just too easy for the modern machine learning algorithms. There is a lot of blank space in the image which makes even a simple Fully Connected Network to achieve greater than 90% accuracy.

The Fashion MNIST Dataset was build to counter that for good. I tried training an FCN and a CNN and could achieve 85.6% and 87.8% accuracy respectively. The CNN accuracy should be more since the FCN performance is not far behind it. But since I am a total beginner I couldn't tune the hyperparameters well enough yet.

In both the networks I used Data Augmentation techiniques like random rotation, random flipping and random shifting by some small values.

TODO - Try to achieve more accuracy with a CNN.
